## **Highlights of Problems**

### 1. **Decoded Strings**
   - **Problem**: Decode strings encoded in the format `k[encoded_string]`.
   - **Example**: 
     - Input: `s = "3[a2[c]]"`
     - Output: `accaccacc`
   - **Techniques Used**: Stacks, recursion.

### 2. **Asteroid Collisions**
   - **Problem**: Determine the state of asteroids after all collisions.
   - **Example**: 
     - Input: `asteroids = [5, 10, -5]`
     - Output: `[5, 10]`
   - **Techniques Used**: Stack-based simulation.

### 3. **Maximum Consecutive 1's II**
   - **Problem**: Find the maximum number of consecutive 1's after flipping at most `k` 0's.
   - **Example**: 
     - Input: `nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2`
     - Output: `6`
   - **Techniques Used**: Sliding window, two-pointer approach.

### 4. **Pivot Index**
   - **Problem**: Find the index where the sum of the numbers to the left is equal to the sum of the numbers to the right.
   - **Example**: 
     - Input: `nums = [1,7,3,6,5,6]`
     - Output: `3`
   - **Techniques Used**: Prefix sums.

### 5. **Unique Number of Occurrences**
   - **Problem**: Check if the occurrences of numbers in an array are unique.
   - **Example**: 
     - Input: `arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]`
     - Output: `true`
   - **Techniques Used**: Hash maps.
